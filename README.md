__*A high-performance molecular quantum dynamics and spectroscopy package*__

* Documentation and instructions for preparing input files can be found at ( https://jprovazza.github.io/mqds ) 

#### This package is currently capable of the following calculations:


* __PLDM__ (Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the __reduced density
 matrix__ of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic 
 oscillators.

* __PLDM__ (Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the __linear 
optical response function__ for a system-bath model where the bath consists 
of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* __PLDM__ (Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the __third order 
optical response function__ for a system-bath model where the bath consists 
of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* __IPLDM__ (Iterative Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the __reduced density
 matrix__ of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic 
 oscillators. This calculation employs the "focusing" procedure, outlined in the IPLDM example directory.

* __TWA__ (Truncated Wigner Approximation) calculation of the __reduced density matrix__ 
of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.
(__currently under construction__)

* __SQC__ (Symmetrical Quasi-Classical) calculation of the __reduced density matrix__ 
of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* __SQC__ (Symmetrical Quasi-Classical) calculation of the __linear optical response function__ 
of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* __EQUILIBRIUM__ Imaginary time path integral calculation of the exact equilibrium 
__reduced density matrix__ in the site basis for a system that has populations bi-linearly
coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators.
